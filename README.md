# Project thesis

There is two project thesis that I will share in github, but for predict rainfall, I won't publish the dataset because this dataset is private.

But still you can replace with dataset time-series for predict Precipitation of rainfall.

For the dataset speech for accent recognition, you can visit https://accent.gmu.edu/
